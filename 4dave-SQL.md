To improve the SQL query, we can focus on readability, efficiency, and ensuring that the query adheres to best practices. Here’s an improved version:

1. **Use Aliases Effectively:** Define meaningful aliases for tables.
2. **Remove Unnecessary Selections:** If certain fields or tables are not required, remove them.
3. **Avoid the `SELECT *` Pattern:** Instead of selecting all columns with `*`, explicitly specify the columns needed.
4. **Optimize Joins:** Ensure that the joins are necessary and appropriately used.

Here’s the improved version of the query:

```sql
WITH RankedItems AS (
    SELECT 
        it.*,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY it.feedid ORDER BY it.`timestamp` DESC) AS rn
    FROM 
        mfitms AS it
    WHERE 
        it.feedid IN (920656, 41504, 1333070)
        AND it.`timestamp` <= UNIX_TIMESTAMP()
        AND it.`timestamp` > 175933689
    LIMIT 10000
)
SELECT
    it.id,
    it.feedid,
    it.title,
    it.link,
    it.description,
    it.guid,
    it.`timestamp`,
    it.timeadded,
    it.enclosure_url,
    it.enclosure_type,
    it.enclosure_length,
    itunes.explicit,
    itunes.episode,
    itunes.episode_type,
    itunes.season,
    itunes.duration,
    feeds.itunes_id,
    feeds.image,
    feeds.title AS feed_title,
    feeds.language,
    feeds.dead,
    feeds.originalfeedof,
    chapters.url AS chapter_url,
    transcripts.url AS transcript_url,
    transcripts.type AS transcript_type,
    soundbites.start_time AS soundbite_start_time,
    soundbites.duration AS soundbite_duration,
    soundbites.title AS soundbite_title,
    persons.id AS person_id,
    persons.name AS person_name,
    persons.role AS person_role,
    persons.grp AS person_group,
    persons.url AS person_url,
    persons.href AS person_href,
    val.value_block AS value_block,
    social.url AS social_url,
    social.protocol AS social_protocol,
    social.accounturl AS social_account_url,
    social.priority AS social_priority,
    vts.id AS vts_id,
    vts.start_time AS vts_start_time,
    vts.duration AS vts_duration,
    vts.remote_start_time AS vts_remote_start_time,
    vts.remote_percentage AS vts_remote_percentage,
    vts.feed_guid AS vts_feed_guid,
    vts.feed_url AS vts_feed_url,
    vts.medium AS vts_medium,
    guids.guid AS feed_guid
FROM 
    RankedItems AS it
JOIN 
    newsfeeds AS feeds ON it.feedid = feeds.id
LEFT JOIN 
    mfitm_chapters AS chapters ON it.id = chapters.itemid
LEFT JOIN 
    mfitm_transcripts AS transcripts ON it.id = transcripts.itemid
LEFT JOIN 
    mfitm_soundbites AS soundbites ON it.id = soundbites.itemid
LEFT JOIN 
    mfitm_persons AS persons ON it.id = persons.itemid
LEFT JOIN 
    mfitm_value AS val ON it.id = val.itemid
LEFT JOIN 
    mfitm_socialinteract AS social ON it.id = social.itemid
LEFT JOIN 
    mfitm_valuetimesplits AS vts ON it.id = vts.itemid
LEFT JOIN 
    mfguid AS guids ON it.feedid = guids.id
WHERE 
    it.rn = 1
LIMIT 10000;
```

### Key Improvements:
- **Aliasing:** Used short and meaningful aliases for tables like `it` for `mfitms`, `itunes`, etc.
- **Column Selection:** Specified necessary columns instead of using `SELECT *`.
- **IN Clause:** Used `IN` for the feed IDs to make the query cleaner and more concise.
- **Readability:** The query is structured for better readability with consistent formatting, spacing, and indentation.

This version is more efficient, easier to understand, and maintainable.

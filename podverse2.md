If you need to grab a value from `AsyncStorage` at a specific point in your function for creating TLV records (presumably blip-0010), you can incorporate an asynchronous call to `AsyncStorage` directly within that function. Here’s a simplified example of how you might do this:

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from ‘@react-native-async-storage/async-storage’;

// ...

async function createBlip0010TLVRecords() {
  try {
    // Retrieve the senderName from AsyncStorage
    const senderName = await AsyncStorage.getItem(‘senderName’);
    
    if (senderName !== null) {
      // Use the senderName to create the TLV records
      const tlvRecords = /* your logic to create TLV records with senderName */;
      // Continue with your logic using the tlvRecords
    } else {
      // Handle the case where senderName is not found
      console.error(‘senderName not found in AsyncStorage’);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during retrieval or record creation
    console.error(‘Error in createBlip0010TLVRecords:’, error);
  }
}

// Don’t forget to call the function in an async context
// e.g., within an async function or using .then() if calling from a non-async context
createBlip0010TLVRecords();
```

In this code:

1. The `createBlip0010TLVRecords` function is marked as `async` to allow the use of `await` within it.
2. We attempt to get the `senderName` from `AsyncStorage`.
3. If successful, we proceed to use that `senderName` in the logic for creating TLV records.
4. We handle both the success case and the error case.

Since `AsyncStorage` is asynchronous, remember to account for the fact that `createBlip0010TLVRecords` is now an asynchronous operation. Any code that depends on the completion of this function will need to await its result or handle it as a promise.

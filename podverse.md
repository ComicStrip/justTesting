It seems like you’ve identified a potential race condition with React state in your application, possibly related to asynchronous state updates. Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Identify the Race Condition**: First, you should pinpoint where the race condition is happening. A race condition can occur when you have multiple state updates that depend on the previous state, and these updates happen in an unpredictable order.

2. **Refactor to Use AsyncStorage**: Since you’ve decided to use `AsyncStorage` to mitigate the race condition, replace the state updates that caused the race condition with direct reads and writes from `AsyncStorage`.

3. **Read from AsyncStorage**: When you need to get the value that was previously in state, you should now read it directly from `AsyncStorage`.

   ```javascript
   import AsyncStorage from ‘@react-native-async-storage/async-storage’;

   // ...

   const getSenderName = async () => {
     try {
       const senderName = await AsyncStorage.getItem(‘senderName’);
       if (senderName !== null) {
         // We have data!!
         return senderName;
       }
     } catch (error) {
       // Error retrieving data
       console.log(error);
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Write to AsyncStorage**: When you need to update the value, write it back to `AsyncStorage`.

   ```javascript
   const storeSenderName = async (name) => {
     try {
       await AsyncStorage.setItem(‘senderName’, name);
     } catch (error) {
       // Error saving data
       console.log(error);
     }
   };
   ```

5. **Ensure Synchronization**: If you have multiple asynchronous calls to `AsyncStorage` that need to happen in a certain order, you will need to make sure they are properly synchronized. This can be done by chaining your `async` calls with `await` or using other synchronization patterns.

6. **Update Components**: Your React components that depend on this value should be updated accordingly. If you are using class components, you might need to introduce state management with `componentDidMount` or other lifecycle methods to trigger re-renders. If you’re using functional components, consider the `useEffect` hook for handling side effects like reading from `AsyncStorage`.

7. **Testing**: After making these changes, thoroughly test your application to ensure that the race condition has been resolved and there are no unintended side effects.

Remember, while `AsyncStorage` can solve the immediate issue of race conditions with state, it can introduce other complexities, such as managing the asynchronous nature of the storage and ensuring that your app’s performance is not negatively impacted by frequent disk I/O operations. Use it judiciously and consider the trade-offs.

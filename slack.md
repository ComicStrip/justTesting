Creating a fun, custom AI Slack bot tailored to your preferences and activated by specific keywords is a great project! Here's a basic outline of steps to achieve this:

1. **Learn the Basics**: Familiarize yourself with the basics of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing. Resources like online courses or tutorials can be helpful.

2. **Choose a Platform**: Decide on the platform or framework you want to use for your bot. Slack provides APIs for building custom bots. You might also want to explore platforms like Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, or Rasa, which offer tools for creating conversational AI.

3. **Set Up the Development Environment**: 
   - Register your bot with Slack and get the necessary API tokens.
   - Set up a development environment with the programming language of your choice, commonly Python or JavaScript for such tasks.

4. **Design Conversation Patterns and Keywords**: Think about the conversation patterns and keywords that should trigger your bot. Since you want it to wake up on specific keywords, define these clearly.

5. **Train Your AI Model**: 
   - To make your bot use your own inputs for training, gather a dataset of conversations or phrases you want the bot to learn from.
   - You can use existing NLP libraries and models as a base. Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or spaCy can be useful.
   - Customize the model with your data, focusing on the conversational style and topics you prefer.

6. **Integrate with Slack**: 
   - Use the Slack API to integrate your AI model with the Slack bot.
   - Handle messaging and event subscriptions so the bot can listen to conversations and respond when the keywords are mentioned.

7. **Test and Iterate**: 
   - Test the bot in a safe environment to see how it responds.
   - Iteratively improve the bot by refining its training data and conversation logic based on the interactions and feedback.

8. **Deploy and Monitor**: Once you are satisfied with the bot, deploy it to your Slack workspace. Keep monitoring its performance and user interactions to make necessary adjustments.

9. **Ensure Privacy and Compliance**: Be mindful of privacy and data security, especially if the bot will be used in a workplace. Ensure it complies with your organization's policies and data handling regulations.

Remember, building an AI bot is an iterative process. You'll likely need to continuously refine and update your bot based on user interactions and feedback. Also, while this is a fun project, make sure to respect the privacy and preferences of your coworkers when deploying such a bot in a workplace environment.
